You’ll enhance your problem-solving, mathematical reasoning, statistics, research and IT skills. In the most recent (2015-16) Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) survey, 100% of graduates from this course were in work or further study within six months.\n\n**More about this course**\n\nThis course gives you the chance to build on the areas of mathematical science that you’re interested in by offering a wide variety of optional modules. Choose from topics such as financial mathematics, coding theory, and algebra and analysis.\n\nYou’ll gain a broad knowledge of the fundamentals of mathematics, as well as the skills to apply your knowledge to a variety of contexts. You’ll develop problem-solving skills, IT proficiency and research techniques, as well as learning about the ways maths might be used in the workplace.\n\n**What our students say**\n\n“I have decided to do this course because I love mathematics and this course has given me the opportunity to deepen this love. I am able to study modules that I enjoy with other students who share the same interests as me. There are friendly teachers, well-equipped labs and the library staff are very helpful and encourage me to explore more fields of mathematics.”\n\n“At London Met I don’t feel as though I only study mathematics, I feel like I’m part of a community of people who share the passion I feel for the subject and the drive to do well. If I could give any advice to anyone thinking of joining the mathematics subject area at London Met it would be stop thinking and secure your place - you will never look back.”",

You’ll learn to use mathematical reasoning in a variety of contexts and apply your knowledge in problem-solving situations.\n\nYou’ll begin by studying the fundamentals of mathematics, such as calculus and linear algebra, and proofs and structures. As the course goes on, you’ll have the opportunity to specialise in your areas of interest such as cryptography and coding, the mathematics of infinity and financial modelling.\n\n**What our students say**\n\n“At London Met I don’t feel as though I only study mathematics, I feel I’m part of a community of people who share my passion and drive to do well. If I could give any advice to anyone thinking of joining the mathematics subject area at London Met it would be: stop thinking and secure your place, you will never look back.”\n\n“I decided to do this course because I love mathematics and this course has given me the opportunity to deepen this love. I am able to study modules that I enjoy with other students who share the same interests as me. Friendly teachers, well-equipped labs and the library are very helpful and encourage me to explore more fields of mathematics.”",

    "university": "University of Leicester",
    "overview": "Why is knife crime on the rise? How can we tackle terrorism? These are the sort of questions that criminal justice professionals explore. This degree gives you a comprehensive overview of criminality – including its causes and impacts on an individual, societal and political level.\n\nCrime and its impact are at the forefront of current political and social debate. We only have to check social media, switch on the television or pick up a newspaper to see headlines about crime and victimisation and to realise how relevant to everyday life the study of criminology has become. Our Criminology BSc enables you to explore the reality behind these headlines and examine a topic that is relevant, topical and has real, practical application in contemporary society.\n\nLeicester ranks 8th in the UK for teaching Criminology (The Guardian University Guide 2024). We are one of very few Schools in the country exclusively dedicated to teaching and researching criminology, and we are home to some of the UK’s leading criminologists. As such, you will benefit from a pure, focused and definitive education in the study of crime. Our strong performance in the National Student Survey since it began in 2005 reflects the popularity of the course among our students, as well as the dedication of the academic staff.\n\nThis course is designed to enable a smooth transition to higher education, providing you with full study skills support and a comprehensive research methods programme which will enable you to complete a research project of your own in your final year. Our degree offers flexibility and choice with a range of option modules for you to choose from, and you have the opportunity to take a Year Abroad between Years 2 and 3 of your degree. The curriculum includes a three-year careers and employability programme, giving you the opportunity to develop the skills youll need for graduate jobs. Job prospects are excellent, with 97% of our criminology students are employed (or studying for a Masters degree) six months after graduating.\n\nOur research expertise feeds directly into our teaching programme, providing innovative and exciting content, as well as keeping you abreast of current debates on crime and criminal justice. Our award-winning research has real impact in wider society, and it influences policy and practice within the UK and beyond. Our research strengths include:\n\nDesistance and rehabilitation\nSexual violence\nForensic science\nHate crime\nInvestigative psychology\nPolicing\nPrisons\nSex work",

    "overview": "Diagnostic radiography combines the empathy and compassion of healthcare with the expertise of managing advanced technology. High-quality diagnostic imagery is fundamental to modern medicine. As a radiographer you will need to know how your equipment and software work and how a human body works.\n\nThis vocational degree, developed and taught by our School of Healthcare in collaboration with University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, is challenging and demanding but also incredibly rewarding – just like a career in radiography.\n\nRadiographers work with nurses, radiologists and other healthcare professionals, creating detailed imagery and data through a variety of techniques, which clinicians can then use as the basis for accurate diagnosis of medical conditions. Almost 40 million imaging tests take place in the UK each year.\n\nOn this degree you will develop your knowledge and skills through a mix of academic study and work-based learning. About 50% of your time will be spent on placement in hospitals across Leicester and Leicestershire, where you will be taught, supervised and assessed – by dedicated, experienced professionals – to ensure you have the skills and knowledge to step into the professional environment.\n\nThe remaining 50% of the course will be spent in lectures and seminars, studying the fundamental topics which underpin the profession, including radiation sciences, imaging technology, anatomy and pathology, and the legal, ethical and professional codes that govern clinical practice.\n\nYou’ll benefit from outstanding facilities. We have a dedicated, state-of-the-art X-Ray room at the nearby Leicester Royal Infirmary that gives you the chance to train in a genuine clinical setting alongside professionals. Our Clinical Skills Unit allows you to undertake interprofessional training alongside our other healthcare students, including life support.\n\nOn completing this course, you will be eligible to apply to become a Registered Diagnostic Radiographer.\n\nStudents on this course are eligible for a grant of at least £5,000 a year, which you do not need to pay back.\n\nThis course is part of the Higher Education Pathway for Armed Forces, which recognises the qualifications, skills and experience of ex-armed forces personnel.\n\nPlease note that this three-year course runs on its own timetable (see Teaching and Learning section for details) rather than the standard university academic year.",

    "overview": "Nutrition and exercise are the most fundamental components of a healthy lifestyle, with inappropriate nutrition and/or insufficient exercise being the most common causes of a wide range of diseases. Correct nutrition is also essential for supporting and maximising sports performance and training adaptations. Our degree in Sport & Exercise Nutrition is therefore ideal for those interested in a future career where exercise and nutrition interact to promote health and sports performance\n\nAn increasing understanding of the role of exercise and nutrition interventions to promote health and sports performance has led to the growth of industry for expert practitioners supporting athletes’ performance needs, and the manufacturing of specialist supplements and food products. Whilst providing a rounded learning and teaching experience in the field of sport & exercise nutrition, our degree also offers the opportunity to focus on one of these specialist areas.\n\nIn the first year of study, you will develop foundational knowledge and understanding of exercise physiology & training adaptations, human nutrition & biochemistry and the relationship between exercise, nutrition and health. This year of study is supported by a wealth of experiences in the exercise and nutrition laboratories where you will acquire key skills to enable the measurement of human function and nutritional status. Your second year of study will involve the specialist study of sports nutrition, nutritional status and health, and the physiological assessment of human performance. In the final year of study, you will consider more advanced and current issues in sports nutrition, ergogenic aids and nutrition, as well as physical activity and behaviour modification for the benefit of health. The final year also offers you the opportunity to undertake original research in the field and opt for your specialised route, either studying the role of a sport nutrition practitioner, or focused on the food/supplement industry and product development.\n\nYou will study within our multi-million Health & Sport Sciences complex, incorporating specialised exercise and nutrition teaching laboratories. Within these you will learn to conduct complete physiological and anthropometric assessments of human function, in addition to understanding clinical nutrition, nutritional biochemistry, food sensory analysis and food product development. You will be taught by tutors who are active researchers in the field and who regularly publish their work in the scientific literature that you will read as you progress through your degree. ",

    "overview": "Economic issues are fascinating but also very complex. The use of large datasets, together with insights from data science, can guide you through this complexity and give you an in-depth understanding of decision-making by governments, businesses and households.\n\nEconomic events occupy the news, capture our attention and affect our lives on a daily basis. There is a wealth of data available, measuring a host of economic, financial, business and social indicators. This course will enable you to apply methods of data analysis and exploit large datasets to get a better understanding of the real-world applicability of economic concepts and ideas.\n\nIt will also facilitate your pursuit of an active role in the economic decision making of organisations and businesses. We will foster your analytical abilities and critical appraisal skills, which are particularly useful transferable skills for graduate employment and will prepare you for a career in the public or private sector, whether that be in economic research, statistical forecasting, financial services or industry.  Your time here will also equip you with the research techniques that are vital for postgraduate study.\n\nThe first year of this course is shared with the following programmes:\n\nBSc Economics\nBSc Financial Economics and Banking\nBSc Business Economics\nBSc Economics and Accounting\nThis means you have the option to switch to any of these other courses at the end of your first year.\n\nThe close relationship between research and teaching is one of the great advantages of studying with us, and we welcome talented students from countries all over the world. Our staff are active researchers of international renown, and have acted as advisors and consultants to many international and national organisations. The School of Business has a dedicated research cluster on Data Analytics, offering advice and expertise on the data science aspects of the course.\n\nFollowing completion of the course you will have a good understanding of the main economic theories and models, but you will also have a very strong set of skills in data analytics.  You will be able to use traditional econometric techniques and more innovative ones (machine learning, artificial intelligence, genetic algorithms, etc) to analyse the large datasets which are used to inform the process of decision making in a business environment or policy setting. These skills are highly sought after by big companies or public organisations such as the ONS, World Bank, regulators, etc.",

    "overview": "Our mission is to create an inclusive, inspiring and enriching education expected of all Leicester undergraduates, to impart a basic understanding of electrical and electronic engineering, to develop skills through education and research and to directly impact how we live and socialise.\n\nElectrical and Electronic Engineering impacts all aspects of life, from transportation and communication to energy and healthcare. With todays global challenges, electrical engineers play a vital role in creating sustainable solutions through technology design, production and maintenance. This programme prepares aspiring engineers to shape the future through renewable energy, robotics, automotive, aerospace, telecoms, agriculture, manufacturing, and more.\n\nInitially, you will gain foundational engineering knowledge through a general first-year course. In the second year, you will deepen your technical skills. Then in year three, you can specialise in one of our specialist streams: (I) Hybrid/Electric Aviation, (II) E-Transportation and Sustainable Energy, or (III) the Internet of Things. Or you can pursue a broadly based BEng covering all three streams. Your final project lets you follow developing interests and career goals.\n\nYou will gain expertise in programming, software, practical and design skills using industry-standard tools. You will also study leadership, ethics, and professional development. MEng students further independent learning through projects and a wide selection of modules that support their career aspirations.\n\nThe BEng/MEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering programme is delivered across three/four academic years of study, respectively, with an additional, optional, industrial placement year or study abroad year after the second year. The optional placement year/year abroad will provide you with the opportunity to gain valuable paid industrial or international experience in a professional environment. By exploring how electrical and electronic systems integrate and serve as indispensable building blocks for a wide range of products, solutions, processes, and business models, you will become a catalyst for change. As a highly sought-after professional, you will contribute to shaping a sustainable future and addressing global challenges like climate change, clean mobility, and an aging society.\n\nWhats the difference?\n\nEach of our Engineering subjects is available in six forms:\n\nBEng (3 years), BEng with Industry (4 years), BEng with Year Abroad (4 years)\nMEng (4 years), MEng with Industry (5 years), MEng with Year Abroad (5 years)\nThe MEng places greater emphasis on industrially related project work, advanced technical content and leadership, and automatically meets the academic requirements for Chartered Engineer (CEng) status. The MEng shares its first three years with the corresponding BEng.",

    "overview": "Our mission is to create an inclusive, inspiring and enriching education expected of all Leicester undergraduates, to impart a basic understanding of electrical and electronic engineering, to develop skills through education and research and to directly impact how we live and socialise.\n\nElectrical and Electronic Engineering impacts all aspects of life, from transportation and communication to energy and healthcare. With todays global challenges, electrical engineers play a vital role in creating sustainable solutions through technology design, production and maintenance. This programme prepares aspiring engineers to shape the future through renewable energy, robotics, automotive, aerospace, telecoms, agriculture, manufacturing, and more.\n\nInitially, you will gain foundational engineering knowledge through a general first-year course. In the second year, you will deepen your technical skills. Then in year three, you can specialise in one of our specialist streams: (I) Hybrid/Electric Aviation, (II) E-Transportation and Sustainable Energy, or (III) the Internet of Things. Or you can pursue a broadly based BEng covering all three streams. Your final project lets you follow developing interests and career goals.\n\nYou will gain expertise in programming, software, practical and design skills using industry-standard tools. You will also study leadership, ethics, and professional development. MEng students further independent learning through projects and a wide selection of modules that support their career aspirations.\n\nThe BEng/MEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering programme is delivered across three/four academic years of study, respectively, with an additional, optional, industrial placement year or study abroad year after the second year. The optional placement year/year abroad will provide you with the opportunity to gain valuable paid industrial or international experience in a professional environment. By exploring how electrical and electronic systems integrate and serve as indispensable building blocks for a wide range of products, solutions, processes, and business models, you will become a catalyst for change. As a highly sought-after professional, you will contribute to shaping a sustainable future and addressing global challenges like climate change, clean mobility, and an aging society.\n\nWhats the difference?\n\nEach of our Engineering subjects is available in six forms:\n\nBEng (3 years), BEng with Industry (4 years), BEng with Year Abroad (4 years)\nMEng (4 years), MEng with Industry (5 years), MEng with Year Abroad (5 years)\nThe MEng places greater emphasis on industrially related project work, advanced technical content and leadership, and automatically meets the academic requirements for Chartered Engineer (CEng) status. The MEng shares its first three years with the corresponding BEng.",

    "overview": "**Why study this course?**\n\nOur Music Business (including foundation year) BA (Hons) degree is a four-year course with a built-in foundation year (Year 0). It’s the perfect start to your university education if you’re interested in studying music business at undergraduate level but you’re unable to meet the entry requirements or dont have the traditional qualifications required to start a standard degree.\n\nOn graduation you’ll be well-prepared to enter an exciting career in the music and entertainment industry. \n\n**More about the course**\n\nThe foundation year of this music business course will provide a general introduction to business and is shared with some of our other business-related foundation year courses.\n\nYou will then go on to study more specialised aspects of music business in Year 1, 2 and 3. We’re one of the first institutions to provide hands-on experience of music business while also teaching you about digital strategies, business models and digital royalties.\n\nExploring music management in the digital age, you’ll study the same course content as our students on the traditional three-year Music Business BA (Hons) degree, graduating from the degree with the same title and award as those who studied the traditional course.\n\nAs well as having the opportunity to develop your business and management expertise during your classes, we supplement your learning with access to our very own business incubator, Accelerator. Accelerator provides advice, support, networks, knowledge and resources to help you turn your business idea into reality.\n\nThis is the ideal degree to propel you into a career in the music industry, but should you decide during your foundation year that you’d like to specialise in a different area of business, there is also some flexibility to allow you to do this.",

    "overview": "Our mission is to create an inclusive, inspiring and enriching education expected of all Leicester undergraduates, to impart a basic understanding of electrical and electronic engineering, to develop skills through education and research and to directly impact how we live and socialise.\n\nElectrical and Electronic Engineering impacts all aspects of life, from transportation and communication to energy and healthcare. With todays global challenges, electrical engineers play a vital role in creating sustainable solutions through technology design, production and maintenance. This programme prepares aspiring engineers to shape the future through renewable energy, robotics, automotive, aerospace, telecoms, agriculture, manufacturing, and more.\n\nInitially, you will gain foundational engineering knowledge through a general first-year course. In the second year, you will deepen your technical skills. Then in year three, you can specialise in one of our specialist streams: (I) Hybrid/Electric Aviation, (II) E-Transportation and Sustainable Energy, or (III) the Internet of Things. Or you can pursue a broadly based BEng covering all three streams. Your final project lets you follow developing interests and career goals.\n\nYou will gain expertise in programming, software, practical and design skills using industry-standard tools. You will also study leadership, ethics, and professional development. MEng students further independent learning through projects and a wide selection of modules that support their career aspirations.\n\nThe BEng/MEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering programme is delivered across three/four academic years of study, respectively, with an additional, optional, industrial placement year or study abroad year after the second year. The optional placement year/year abroad will provide you with the opportunity to gain valuable paid industrial or international experience in a professional environment. By exploring how electrical and electronic systems integrate and serve as indispensable building blocks for a wide range of products, solutions, processes, and business models, you will become a catalyst for change. As a highly sought-after professional, you will contribute to shaping a sustainable future and addressing global challenges like climate change, clean mobility, and an aging society.\n\nWhats the difference?\n\nEach of our Engineering subjects is available in six forms:\n\nBEng (3 years), BEng with Industry (4 years), BEng with Year Abroad (4 years)\nMEng (4 years), MEng with Industry (5 years), MEng with Year Abroad (5 years)\nThe MEng places greater emphasis on industrially related project work, advanced technical content and leadership, and automatically meets the academic requirements for Chartered Engineer (CEng) status. The MEng shares its first three years with the corresponding BEng.",

    "overview": "Our well-established course is designed for bilingual students and is run jointly by the University of Leicester and the University of Strasbourg.\n\nThe first two years of your course is spent here in Leicester, leading to the award of the LLB degree (conferred at the end of your time in Strasbourg). You then move to the Université de Strasbourg for a further two years. Successful completion of the programme there culminates in the award of a Maîtrise de Droit with the designation Droits Français et Anglais. You will also gain a specialisation in private, corporate, or public European law.\n\nYour transition to study in Strasbourg is supported by a non-examined bespoke French law conversion module and you have access to optional additional courses with Languages at Leicester (for French) or the English Language Teaching Unit (for English). During the 3rd and final year of the degree in France, you will pay French university course fees.\n\nWhen you graduate you will be awarded with two qualifying law degrees: LLB and Maîtrise. These qualifications will reflect your competence in English, French, and European law. The Maîtrise is similar to the LLB in that it qualifies you for the professional examinations in France.\n\nStrasbourg is the home of European integration. You will study within walking distance of the World Heritage Site of the Grande Île, the official seat of the European Parliament and the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nYour bilingualism and proficiency in multiple legal systems will make you a perfect candidate for employment within European governmental bodies. As many leading law firms have branches in other countries or undertake cross-border work, and Strasbourg is the host of many international organisations of the highest order, this course will give you a distinct competitive advantage when beginning your legal career.",

Major historical events affect authors, works, literary and cultural movements, even language itself, in important and complex ways, from the Norman Conquest to the Reformation, and from the Civil War to the Cold War and beyond. The English and History BA brings together these two naturally complementary subjects by grouping modules in such a way that they support and enrich one another.\n\nYou will explore English Literature and History from every period, and encounter a broad range of approaches and methodologies. A variety of option modules will allow you to deepen your understanding of those subjects that you find most fascinating. Our graduates leave Leicester with an unrivalled breadth of knowledge and skills.\n\nThis course will help you to understand how writers have been influenced by their wider contexts, how they have represented the world around them, and how to read and interpret texts in light of their history.\n\nYou will have access to library collections that include material that dates back to the 12th century. Our special collections of manuscripts and historical books offer a direct connection with the past.\n\nIn your first and second year you will divide your time equally between English and History modules. You third year offers you the chance to specialise more in the area that interests you the most. You will have the opportunity to study a vast range of English and History modules from the Middle Ages to the present day.",

You will also come to understand the wider professional writing industries, which could include film, publishing, editing, performance, and literary events.\n\nWhile reading Wilde or Dickens, you will be composing your own prose narratives; while learning about life-writing you might be reading the autobiographies of Nabokov, Wright or Maya Angelou.

    "overview": "**Why study this course?**\n\nOur vocationally oriented degree course combines biology and chemistry to examine drug design, targets and delivery. You’ll learn how drugs affect the human body through theoretical teaching, lab work and optional work placements, and will be taught by a number of research-active staff who have close links with the industry.\n\n**More about this course**\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered how new medicines are invented, this could be the course for you. You’ll follow the entire process of rational drug design, from identifying biological targets that link to diseases to optimising lead compounds that recognise these targets.\n\nYou’ll also learn about the parameters that affect the delivery of drugs to specific sites in the body, in order to gain a better understanding of how drugs can be administered to deliver maximum results with minimum side effects.\n\nIn your first year, you’ll gain a solid grounding in the fundamentals of chemistry and related biological subjects. As the course progresses, you’ll cover these topics at a greater depth, as well as having the opportunity to specialise in subjects that interest you.\n\nThe practical elements of this course will be undertaken in our £30 million Science Centre, which is equipped with over 280 workstations and state-of-the-art specialist laboratories. You’ll also get the chance to undertake a work placement in your third year, where you’ll gain valuable, real-world experience.\n\n**What our students say**\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Science course was the perfect choice for me. I am passionate about chemistry and can’t wait to start formulating, but need to understand the biological implications. This course gives me the opportunity to do all of these things. I have found the course challenging and thoroughly interesting. After only a year I feel I have learned so much – I’m looking forward to Year 2!\nMignon Cristofoli, Year 1 student\n\nI find the Pharmaceutical Science degree very informative and enjoyable, especially in the second year as we actually get to learn about the pharmaceutical industry. Working in the biggest laboratory in the UK is a great experience and many skills can be obtained. The lectures are always interesting and the lecturers are always helpful.\nNelushna Manmatharajah, Year 2 student\n\nI started my time at London Met in 2012 with a foundation year. I was not really sure which path I would take, but four years on Im happy to call myself a pharmaceutical scientist! I am extremely grateful for the chance to have met and worked with some incredibly talented and passionate teachers!\nElina Zalite, Year 3 student",

    "university": "University of Leicester",
    "overview": "At Leicester you will explore the history, theory and art of film – the most universal of all the popular arts. During your time with us you will gain a thorough grounding in the history of cinema as a social practice and an understanding of a wide range of different national and transnational cinemas, film cultures, styles and genres. You will also look beyond the screen to learn about the process of making films – including making your own film – and to understand the role that film plays in society and culture.\n\nOur Film Studies BA provides you with the necessary skills to critically analyse film. You will gain an understanding of how directors and producers approach their work, how critics and other audiences consume film and give voice to their opinions, and of the place of cinema within different social, cultural, historical and industrial contexts.\n\nLeicester is ranked among the top 12 places in the UK for Film Studies*. We offer an exciting and wide-ranging approach to the study of film, television and other visual arts. You will study filmmaking from the silent era to the twenty-first century, from Hollywood to the avant-garde, and different national and transnational cinemas.\n\nPractical experience and employability are also core elements of the degree; you will gain hands-on experience in programming and promoting a ‘film and art’ event, and have the opportunity to work as part of a team to produce a short video.\n\nYour first year is designed to equip you with the key skills and concepts to study film as an art form. During your second year you will work in groups to create your own short film, using your firm grounding in film theory. You will also augment your focus on film through modules in which you study television and in which you will work with other students in the School of Arts mastering key critical concepts.\n\n*Complete University Guide 2024 (Communication and Media Studies)",

    "overview": "From prosthetic limbs to exploratory spacecraft, engineers build extraordinary things. But doing so often takes more than specialist expertise. In this general engineering degree, you’ll take a broad approach by choosing the areas that fascinate you most.\n\nEngineers are innovators who bring about change through their ingenuity, experience and curiosity to improve the quality of life for people throughout the world. Their work is central to thriving economies and competitive industries. It is equally important in developing countries where engineers provide appropriate technologies during difficult times of change.\n\nProfessional engineers have a high degree of specialist knowledge but increasingly they use a broad approach to problem-solving across a range of engineering disciplines. This is coupled with an awareness of environmental, social, legal, economic and regulatory aspects of the problem at hand.\n\nWhether you study for the BEng or the MEng, your General Engineering degree will equip you for a career in modern industry and commerce where a broad understanding of the subject is paramount.\n\nUnlike some other universities, Engineering at Leicester has always been viewed as a unified subject and all engineering research and teaching staff belong to a single School. This has significant advantages for our graduates who leave here familiar with a broad range of topics and techniques in electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering. While this is an advantage to all our courses it provides a special quality to our General Engineering degrees.\n\nYou will take business, control, design, engineering mathematics, experimentation, management courses and specialist electrical and mechanical options. These are carefully selected to provide overall coherence and balance, ensuring a good foundation for interdisciplinary projects in a wide range of professions. General Engineering graduates are highly sought-after by engineering employers, due to their broad skill set and adaptability. They are also able to move into specialist areas such as biomedical engineering, systems engineering or patenting.\n\nSuccessful engineers must be able to analyse and solve complex problems in the industrial context, communicate ideas to others, work effectively in teams and exercise leadership skills. This is why all our Engineering degrees include business, integrated design, management and professional development activities throughout. Topics covered include business finance, project planning and management, intellectual property, health and safety, motivation theory, marketing, total quality management, ethics and professionalism.\n\nWhats the difference?\nEach of our Engineering subjects is available in six forms:\n\nBEng (3 years), BEng with Industry (4 years), BEng with Year Abroad (4 years)\nMEng (4 years), MEng with Industry (5 years), MEng with Year Abroad (5 years)\nThe MEng places greater emphasis on industrially-related project work, advanced technical content and leadership, and automatically meets the academic requirements for Chartered Engineer (CEng) status. The MEng shares its first three years with the corresponding BEng.",

    "overview": "How does modern economic study relate to the banking system and financial markets? What role do financial systems play in global economics and how can we better understand their true impact? These are big questions, but you’ll break them down by studying the very fundamentals of economics.\n\nBe among the first to study at our new £16 million Brookfield campus, with state-of-the-art learning and facilities exclusive to Leicester School of Business students. Our BSc Financial Economics and Banking will introduce you to a broad range of topics including banking, financial intermediation, asset and liability management, financial decision making and financial markets and institutions.\n\nThis wide range of topics will give you an in-depth understanding of the way that financial organisations and markets work. You will learn to apply economic theory in financial contexts, for example the appraisal of competing investment opportunities and how government policy influences the stock market and the banking sector.\n\nThe course will familiarise you to techniques such as derivatives pricing, risk management methods and portfolio management, while you will also become a proficient user of financial software and complex data sources which will enable you to better understand the impact and reach of economic decisions.\n\nYou can study the syllabus for the CFA Institute Investment Foundations Certificate at the School of Business, helping prepare you to take the examination for the CFA Institute Investment Foundations Certificate directly with the CFA. In addition, the Financial Economics and Banking BSc is accredited by CIMA, the professional body of management accountants.\n\nAn optional year studying abroad or undertaking an industry placement will enhance your skills and build your professional network. Your time with us will also equip you with the research techniques that are vital to postgraduate study.\n\nThe close relationship between research and teaching is one of the great advantages of studying with us, and we welcome talented students from countries all over the world. Our staff are active researchers of international renown, and have acted as advisers and consultants to many international and national organisations, including the European Central Bank, the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the Central Bank of Poland, the Central Bank of Greece and a number of UK Government departments.\n\nThe first year of this degree is shared with the following BSc degrees:\n\nBusiness Economics BSc\nEconomics and Data Analytics BSc\nEconomics BSc\nEconomics and Accounting BSc\nThis means that you have the option to switch to any of these courses at the end of your first year.",

    "overview": "**Why study this course**\n\nOur Photography (including foundation year) BA (Hons) is a four-year degree that includes an intensive foundation year (Year 0), which will give you the chance to explore a range of creative approaches and build a substantial portfolio of work before you progress to your subsequent years of studying photography.\n\nThis is a great route into a photography degree, particularly if you don’t hold the necessary requirements to begin a three-year undergraduate photography degree.\n\nOur Photography (including foundation year) BA degree is one of a number of art and photography courses at our School of Art, Architecture and Design with an excellent reputation. The Guardian’s university league tables 2020 rank our art and photography courses seventh in the UK and third in London.\n\n**More about this course**\n\nDuring your foundation year you’ll have the opportunity to explore a number of different artistic directions and gain a broad spectrum of creative skills before going on to specialise more specifically in photography at the end of your first year of study.\n\nYoull begin your foundation year by undertaking a range of short and intensive studio workshops that will allow you to develop key photography skills and techniques, which will stand you in good stead for the rest of your degree. You’ll also develop a strong work ethic, which is essential when studying an art-related degree.\n\nYou will follow these intensive workshops with longer projects that will allow you to delve deeper into your own creative style and approach, strengthening your independence as an artist and photographer.\n\nYou will also look at creative practice from a contemporary, conceptual, cultural and historical context through lectures and seminars.\n\nFeedback is essential to your development as a creative practitioner, so throughout the course there will be plenty of opportunities for your peers and tutors to critique your work. This will not only allow you to improve your artistic practice, but will also help you prepare for the exhibition at the end of the year, when your work will be on show to the general public.\n\nAfter completing your foundation year, you will study the same modules and content as students enrolled on our Photography BA (Hons).\n\nHowever, if you decide during your foundation year that you’d prefer to specialise in another art-related subject, there will be flexibility to do this.",

    "overview": "**Why study this course?**\n\nPsychology is central to understanding people and their behaviour. Our Psychology BSc is accredited by the British Psychological Society (BPS) as granting eligibility for the Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership (GBC), which is an essential first step towards becoming a chartered psychologist. Gaining GBC through our Psychology BSc course will allow you to progress to specialised postgraduate training and a career in psychology.\n\nThe course is designed to ensure you develop a thorough understanding of the core areas in psychology (biological, cognitive, developmental, social, individual differences, and research methods). You’ll also a wide range of academic and transferable skills that will be invaluable in future employment or postgraduate training.\n\n**More about this course**\n\nYou’ll learn how people think, feel and behave in different situations. You’ll also learn how to challenge and explore common assumptions and address questions such as: Why do some people become addicted to drugs? Why do people behave differently on social media? Why do some people develop eating disorders or phobias? Why are some people more forgetful?  \n\nOur Psychology BSc provides the perfect foundation for a wide variety of employment opportunities or future training as a professional psychologist. In your first year, you’ll gain a broad understanding of the different areas of psychology and essential research skills. In your second year, you’ll broaden your knowledge base and explore more complex topics, such as intelligence, creativity, decision making and prejudice. Your final year will offer you the chance to specialise in an area that interest you the most, such as forensic, work, counselling or clinical psychology. These modules offer advanced understanding of psychological theory, research and practice, which is taught by experts in their field and psychology practitioner. \n\nThroughout the course you’ll learn how to use specialist methods and equipment, gaining practical skills in psychological research. You’ll undertake an individual research project under the supervision of an academic tutor. The knowledge you’ll gain from the course can be applied in the real-world to many different contexts and situations.\n\n**What our students say**\n\nI would recommend the psychology undergraduate degree to anyone, the knowledge and life skills you will learn are priceless and this degree will open more doors than you can imagine. I am a single mum to a teenager and I also work two different jobs but the support you get on this course from some brilliant lecturers enabled me to completely engage in the full-time degree and achieve very good grades. If a degree was easy, it wouldnt be worth the paper it is printed on but if you manage your time effectively and take advantage of the interesting, engaging, and at times fun lectures, seminars and workshops, there is every chance of qualifying with remarkable results. If I can do it, anyone can.\nEmma Smith, former student\n\nI have a first-class honours degree in Psychology and was awarded the British Psychology Society Undergraduate Award at London Met. Currently, I am in the process of completing an MSc in clinical neuroscience at a prestigious university. I can honestly say that my experience at London Met was fantastic. The level of support that lecturers provide students along with effort is stupendous. London Met is a place where lecturers care not only about students performance but about their wellbeing too.\nMonica Pereira, former student",

    "overview": "From prosthetic limbs to exploratory spacecraft, engineers build extraordinary things. But doing so often takes more than specialist expertise. In this general engineering degree, you’ll take a broad approach by choosing the areas that fascinate you most.\n\nEngineers are innovators who bring about change through their ingenuity, experience and curiosity to improve the quality of life for people throughout the world. Their work is central to thriving economies and competitive industries. It is equally important in developing countries where engineers provide appropriate technologies during difficult times of change.\n\nProfessional engineers have a high degree of specialist knowledge but increasingly they use a broad approach to problem-solving across a range of engineering disciplines. This is coupled with an awareness of environmental, social, legal, economic and regulatory aspects of the problem at hand.\n\nWhether you study for the BEng or the MEng, your General Engineering degree will equip you for a career in modern industry and commerce where a broad understanding of the subject is paramount.\n\nUnlike some other universities, Engineering at Leicester has always been viewed as a unified subject and all engineering research and teaching staff belong to a single School. This has significant advantages for our graduates who leave here familiar with a broad range of topics and techniques in electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering. While this is an advantage to all our courses it provides a special quality to our General Engineering degrees.\n\nYou will take business, control, design, engineering mathematics, experimentation, management courses and specialist electrical and mechanical options. These are carefully selected to provide overall coherence and balance, ensuring a good foundation for interdisciplinary projects in a wide range of professions. General Engineering graduates are highly sought-after by engineering employers, due to their broad skill set and adaptability. They are also able to move into specialist areas such as biomedical engineering, systems engineering or patenting.\n\nSuccessful engineers must be able to analyse and solve complex problems in the industrial context, communicate ideas to others, work effectively in teams and exercise leadership skills. This is why all our Engineering degrees include business, integrated design, management and professional development activities throughout. Topics covered include business finance, project planning and management, intellectual property, health and safety, motivation theory, marketing, total quality management, ethics and professionalism.\n\nWhats the difference?\nEach of our Engineering subjects is available in six forms:\n\nBEng (3 years), BEng with Industry (4 years), BEng with Year Abroad (4 years)\nMEng (4 years), MEng with Industry (5 years), MEng with Year Abroad (5 years)\nThe MEng places greater emphasis on industrially-related project work, advanced technical content and leadership, and automatically meets the academic requirements for Chartered Engineer (CEng) status. The MEng shares its first three years with the corresponding BEng.",

    "overview": "**Why study this course?**\n\nThis course combines the insights of psychology with those of sociology, enabling you to better understand human behaviour and the different genetic, biological, individual, social and developmental factors that can influence it. You’ll have the opportunity to specialise in areas of interest, such as ethnicity, youth and workplace psychology. \n\n**More about this course**\n\nThis joint honours degree will allow you to look at human behaviour from two different perspectives. Psychology integrates theory and evidence-based knowledge from areas including genetics, biology, individuality and development. Sociology looks at contemporary social issues, practical sociological research and social relations. \n\nOver the course of this degree you’ll develop an understanding of both disciplines and gain the essential research and analytical skills required in both subjects. You’ll look at humans as individuals and communities, while exploring issues that are becoming increasingly relevant in today’s society such as global inequality, gender and sexuality and religion.\n\nThis degree offers the best of both worlds. While not a qualifying psychology degree, it opens doors for further study and a career in a wide range of sectors. It will equip you with an understanding of social themes, as well as practical and transferable skills that are applicable within any sphere of your work life. If you’re interested in becoming a qualified psychologist, you’ll be able to complete a conversion degree after graduation.\n\nYou’ll have the opportunity to undertake a work placement in your third year, giving you the chance to gain valuable hands-on experience. In the past, our students have completed relevant placements in public and third sector organisations such as the NHS, Notting Hill Genesis and St Mungo’s. \n\nWe’re a tight-knit course group, which means we’re able to offer you outstanding support during your studies. You’ll experience support from fellow students on the course and through one-to-one meetings with your academic tutor. As a student of London Met you’ll also gain access to a range of services including career advice.",

    "overview": "Geography is a discipline founded on understanding the complex links between Earth, its inhabitants, and the places they live. As a Human Geographer, you will learn to think critically and creatively about the world we live in and key challenges society faces for the coming century.\n\nThis degree is perfect for you if you wish to experience the full breadth of Geography, but would like specialise primarily in Human Geography. After a common first year with BSc students, in Years 2 and 3, we offer a diversity of optional Human Geography modules, covering topics like migration, environmental governance and justice, climate change, gentrification, energy and food security and geopolitics. There remain some Physical Geography module options in years 2 and 3, so you can tailor your degree to become a generalist, or a specialist in Human Geography, depending on your interests. \n\nThroughout your degree, there will be an emphasis on critical thinking and the development of a suite of quantitative and qualitative research skills. We encourage and train our students to be both critical and creative in their research approaches and methods. We use innovative teaching and assessment methods and encourage our students to reflect upon the role Human Geographers play in the modern world.\n\nIf you decide at the end of Year 1 that you want to specialise in Physical Geography, you can transfer to the Geography BSc degree.

    "overview": "From prosthetic limbs to exploratory spacecraft, engineers build extraordinary things. But doing so often takes more than specialist expertise. In this general engineering degree, you’ll take a broad approach by choosing the areas that fascinate you most.\n\nEngineers are innovators who bring about change through their ingenuity, experience and curiosity to improve the quality of life for people throughout the world. Their work is central to thriving economies and competitive industries. It is equally important in developing countries where engineers provide appropriate technologies during difficult times of change.\n\nProfessional engineers have a high degree of specialist knowledge but increasingly they use a broad approach to problem-solving across a range of engineering disciplines. This is coupled with an awareness of environmental, social, legal, economic and regulatory aspects of the problem at hand.\n\nWhether you study for the BEng or the MEng, your General Engineering degree will equip you for a career in modern industry and commerce where a broad understanding of the subject is paramount.\n\nUnlike some other universities, Engineering at Leicester has always been viewed as a unified subject and all engineering research and teaching staff belong to a single School. This has significant advantages for our graduates who leave here familiar with a broad range of topics and techniques in electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering. While this is an advantage to all our courses it provides a special quality to our General Engineering degrees.\n\nYou will take business, control, design, engineering mathematics, experimentation, management courses and specialist electrical and mechanical options. These are carefully selected to provide overall coherence and balance, ensuring a good foundation for interdisciplinary projects in a wide range of professions. General Engineering graduates are highly sought-after by engineering employers, due to their broad skill set and adaptability. They are also able to move into specialist areas such as biomedical engineering, systems engineering or patenting.\n\nSuccessful engineers must be able to analyse and solve complex problems in the industrial context, communicate ideas to others, work effectively in teams and exercise leadership skills. This is why all our Engineering degrees include business, integrated design, management and professional development activities throughout. Topics covered include business finance, project planning and management, intellectual property, health and safety, motivation theory, marketing, total quality management, ethics and professionalism.\n\nWhats the difference?\nEach of our Engineering subjects is available in six forms:\n\nBEng (3 years), BEng with Industry (4 years), BEng with Year Abroad (4 years)\nMEng (4 years), MEng with Industry (5 years), MEng with Year Abroad (5 years)\nThe MEng places greater emphasis on industrially-related project work, advanced technical content and leadership, and automatically meets the academic requirements for Chartered Engineer (CEng) status. The MEng shares its first three years with the corresponding BEng.",

You’ll receive a world-class introduction to all aspects of the industry, equipping you with the skills and networks needed for employment, self-employment or further postgraduate study.\n\nThe teaching team for this undergraduate design course is made up of experienced educators and internationally recognised designers (read about them below), whose work with leading design brands and galleries can be found in the permanent collections of the UK Crafts Council, Design Museum Holon, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Gewerbemuseum in Switzerland, amongst others.\n\nDriven by curiosity and a can-do attitude, you’ll become a competent maker, opinionated thinker and a flexible designer with a set of industry-relevant skills and experiences. This in turn will empower you to find your own voice in the expanding and evolving product and furniture design world.\n\n**More about this course**\n\nInspired by the vibrant energy of our London home and the university’s one-hundred-year heritage, we embrace the collision of past, present and future – from digital 3D fabrication to traditional craft – to help you learn a rigorous design approach that is deeply connected to material, making and process, all informed by empathy for the end user, insightful observation and sound ethical choices.\n\nYour impressive roster of tutors will be made up internationally recognised product and furniture designers, who together offer a dynamic practice-based learning culture that will encourage the exploration and discovery of your own interests and approaches through both experimentation and trial and error. What’s more, this all takes place in our realistic studio environment.\n\nYou’ll develop your practical skills during first year briefs that focus on specific materials and processes (including, wood, ceramics, metal and digital fabrication), equipping you with the know-how needed to make use of the extensive workshops for the remainder of the course. In your second and final years you’ll gain experience of working on live project briefs for major brands, with partners including 1882, SCP, Lodes Lighting and Brompton.",

    "overview": "Our planet has constantly reshaped itself, but in the twenty-first century, the impact of humanity on all aspects of the planetary machine is undeniable. In this respect, the world needs Geographers more than ever. Geography is a discipline founded on understanding the complex links between the planet, its inhabitants, and the places where they live.  As a Physical Geographer, you will help us to tackle the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nThis degree is perfect for you if you wish to experience the full breadth of Geography, but would like specialise primarily in Physical Geography. After a common first year with BA students, in Years 2 and 3 we offer a diversity of optional Physical Geography modules, covering topics spanning river systems, tropical rainforests, deserts and climate change. There remain Human Geography module options in years 2 and 3, so you can tailor your degree to become a generalist, or a specialist in Physical Geography, depending on your interests. Throughout you will gain transferable skills in remote sensing, geographical information science and statistical and data presentation methods.\n\nThe degree includes UK residential fieldwork in Years 1 and 2 going to Devon, Dartmoor and the Lake District. In Year 2 we take you to Almeria (Spain) to explore Europes only desert. There are options for further residential fieldwork around the world in Year 3.\n\nIf at the end of Year 1 you decide you would prefer to focus primarily on human geography, you can transfer to the BA degree in Year 2.

    "overview": "We are walking on billions of years of Earth history. In this geology degree, you will learn how to piece it all together to understand how our planet works, and see how geologists make a difference to society and the planet.\n\nOur Geology degrees gives you a broad training in the geosciences, from the structure and history of our planet and life on Earth, to the natural resources that geologists need to manage for a sustainable future. You may have already discovered that every rock tells a fascinating story: perhaps it was formed in a volcano, or preserves dinosaur remains, or a chemical signature of past oceans, or a rare mineral with high-tech applications. Our Geology degree helps you piece it all together to arrive at a profound understanding of our planet and the role of the geoscientist in today’s world.\n\nThe first year lays the foundations by introducing you to the full spectrum of geoscience topics, including the rock cycle, palaeontology, natural resources, and geological maps. You will undertake a field trip to the beautiful Isle of Arran in Scotland where you can put into practice everything you have learn on campus. In the second year you will develop your skills and understanding, and in the third year, develop specialist expertise to help realise your potential. You can choose optional modules to reflect your developing interests, and take field trips to UK and overseas locations. By choosing the Geology degree, you will have more option choices than students on specialist degree streams, though it’s easy to change at the end of the first year if you discover a particular interest in palaeontology or applied and environmental geology. Explore the different modules in detail using the links on this page.\n\nBSc or MGeol: whats the difference?\n\nApply for a BSc degree if you want an ideal three-year route to becoming a professional geologist or you’re looking to pursue further geological studies through a specialist MSc course.\n\nApply for a four-year MGeol degree if you are looking to fast-track your professional geological employment or to continue on to PhD research after graduation. MGeol courses include a major cutting-edge independent research project on a topic chosen by you, giving you the opportunity to work with specialist analytical facilities, learn the skills required to succeed in a research environment and potentially see your work published in a peer-reviewed journal. Plus you may be able to spend your third year abroad.\n\nIt is possible to transfer between the BSc and the MGeol up to the end of Year 2. ",

    "overview": "There’s always another way to follow your passion. If you don’t quite have the entry requirements to study geology at Leicester, this STEM Foundation Year degree is for you.\n\nGeology at Leicester provides a friendly, dynamic and supportive environment in which to learn about the history of our planet and life on Earth. You will be taught by staff recognised internationally for their expertise in fields such as palaeontology, economic geology, volcanology, structural geology, geophysics, and palaeoenvironments. You will benefit from our excellent facilities, ranging from dedicated student study spaces, 24/7 secure access to the building, and collections of over 250,000 specimens of rocks, fossils and minerals to help you learn. In later years, you can choose modules that give you experience of our research facilities, including advanced microscopes and geochemistry labs.\n\nAll of our geology-focussed degrees include common modules in the first year, so you can easily transfer between courses as you discover the topics that inspire you most and best match your career aspirations. From the third year you can choose from a range of optional modules, and it is also possible to transfer between the three-year BSc and the four-year MGeol degrees, so you can graduate with the most appropriate qualification for your future career. Our Physical Geography and Geology degree is a bit different, with a tailor-made programme right from the start, and plenty of options later on. For details of all the modules, follow the links under each degree course.\n\nWe pride ourselves on our excellent staff-student relations and have high student satisfaction levels, not least because of our small-group teaching and tutorials, which provide individually tailored academic and pastoral support throughout your degree. You will learn through a combination of lectures, practical classes, workshops, small-group tutorials, and field trips. This means you will have plenty of contact time with the lecturers, who are happy to provide feedback as you progress through each module. Your assessments will be a mixture of exams, presentations, written reports, group projects and other activities, as we recognise that everyone has different strengths and preferred ways of learning. For many students, fieldwork is one of the highlights of their time at Leicester.\n\nAll of our geology focussed courses are accredited by the Geological Society, demonstrating that our degrees offer high-quality teaching as well as providing the skills necessary for a career as a professional geoscientist. Furthermore, our graduates are highly sought after in many professions because of the breadth of skills you will develop, including high levels of independence, team-working, and data analysis. We have a strong emphasis on embedding skills within our modules, and we provide careers advice throughout your degree, including an annual in-house careers event and through our excellent links with industry partners and alumni.\n\nWith diverse modules to choose from to develop your own interests, and with excellent field programmes and numerous scholarships and bursaries available to support your studies, we are committed to helping you achieve your full academic potential.",

    "overview": "The history of life on Earth is written in the rocks, and it takes a palaeontologist to decipher it. If you love fossils, and what they can tell us about evolution and environmental change, then this geology degree is for you.\n\nPalaeontology addresses how the origin and evolution of life is intricately linked with the geological history of the Earth. Through the fossil record you will explore topics such as evolutionary diversity, exceptional preservation and palaeoclimates. We will cover key groups of invertebrate fossils, vertebrate fossils and microfossils, investigating major concepts such as the origin of life, patterns of evolution and extinction, the importance of exceptional fossil assemblages, and the relationship between ecology and evolution.\n\nYou will also learn about the geological context in which fossils occur. This includes the environments where fossils became preserved, the age of the rocks that contain them, and biases resulting from geological processes. Furthermore, fossils provide crucial information for understanding current changes in ecosystems and the climate. The first-year modules will lay the foundations in palaeontology and across the breadth of the geosciences, and include a field-trip to the beautiful Isle of Arran in Scotland. Also, by choosing the Geology with Palaeontology degree when you apply, you will be assigned to a personal tutor who is a specialist in the field. In the second year, you will develop your skills and understanding across the geosciences, and start to specialise through a bespoke palaeontology module on major events in the history of life, and by choosing a palaeontological focus for your independent fieldwork. In the third year, you will develop specialist expertise through modules on vertebrates and microfossils, plus a dissertation on a palaeontological topic of your choice, and a specialist field trip. Your knowledge of palaeontology will also complement other modules including second-year climate change and the third-year optional module on stable isotopes.\n\nEach year of the degree includes different field work opportunities including trips to Scotland, Spain and Wales where you will be able to apply all that you have learned here on campus. You will also carry out an independent field-based project which may range from geological mapping in a fossiliferous area, to field and laboratory analysis of fossils.\n\nBSc or MGeol: whats the difference? \n\nWhether you study for the Geology with Palaeontology BSc or the MGeol, your degree will combine the knowledge and skills base of a degree in geology with the development of expertise in the scientific study of fossils.\n\nApply for a BSc degree if you want an ideal three-year route to becoming a professional geologist or you’re looking to pursue further geological studies through a specialist MSc course.\n\nApply for a four-year MGeol degree if you are looking to fast-track your professional geological employment or to continue on to PhD research after graduation. MGeol courses include a major cutting-edge independent research project on a topic chosen by you, giving you the opportunity to work with specialist analytical facilities, learn the skills required to succeed in a research environment and potentially see your work published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nIt is possible to transfer between the BSc and the MGeol up to the end of Year ",

If you don’t quite have the entry requirements to study geography at Leicester, this STEM Foundation Year degree is for you.    \n\nOur integrated Science, Technology and Engineering (STEM) Foundation Year degrees are aimed at students who wish to study a STEM subject, such as physics, but dont have the traditional entry requirements.\n\nThe course is run on the University of Leicester campus like any other, and you will be studying alongside other students who applied for, and slightly missed out on, a place on a course similar to yours. In the first year of this course you will all be working towards passing a foundation year (year 0), which will enable automatic progression onto year 1 of any of our BSc Geography courses.\n\nBy completing the Foundation Year you will automatically progress onto the first year of your chosen degree. \n\nThe course strongly emphasises the development of essential professional and personal skills, which are necessary throughout your studies and beyond. \nDuring your Foundation Year you will join our student community and be able to enjoy all aspects of the University of Leicester student experience. You will be able to join the Students’ Union, use our academic and leisure facilities, live in our accommodation and access all our support services. \nYou will have a personal tutor to support you.

You’ll benefit from an extra year that will help you succeed at undergraduate level, but you’ll graduate with the same award and title as students on the standard three-year course.\n\n**More about this course**\n\nOur social work bachelors degree with a foundation year will provide you with knowledge, skills and experience to enter or progress your career within the health and social care sector.\n\nThe foundation year will equip you with valuable transferable skills that will help you succeed in any workplace – you’ll learn how to manage your workload, critically analyse information and improve your academic writing skills. During the foundation year, you’ll also complete a taster module in social work, so that you can prepare for more in-depth study of the subject in the subsequent three years of your course.\n\nYour foundation year will be shared with students from other specialisms studying a foundation year in the School of Social Professions. This will be the perfect opportunity to learn about other disciplines and exchange different perspectives on the topics you study.\n\nDuring your foundation year you’ll also complete a module in social work. This module will help you develop the necessary knowledge and skills that will give you an introduction to studying social work at undergraduate level. This module will also prepare you for the application process for the Social Work BSc (Hons) course. Upon successful completion of assessed group and written tests you will be put forward to the individual interview stage. If you pass this stage, you’ll join students on our Social Work BSc (Hons) course and study the same content and modules as them. If you are unsuccessful but pass all your modules, you can choose another course at the University, subject to meeting entry requirements.\n\nYou are encouraged to attend an Open Day event if you have any queries and would like to speak to an academic member of staff.",
